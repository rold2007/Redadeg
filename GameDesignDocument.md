# Game Overview
Race on foot in medieval castles.

# Look and feel
A 2D pixel art game where everything holds in one screen, like Pac-Man.

# Game design
It is an arcade style game, similar to [Super Off Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Off_Road). The character control will be simple, like [Overcooked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overcooked) without the need to remember plenty of keyboard shorcuts.

The player will play as a dwarf running against other dwarves. To beat their opponents, the dwarves are allowed to sprint for a short distance and hit the other dwarves (the level of violence must be limited to let kids play). This will make the target fall and allow the other players to take the lead.

The decor will also play against the runners, there might be guards patrolling, angry gooses to avoid, tunnels to enter to go under the castle walls, etc.

The first race will be easier to allow the player to understand how the game works. As such, there will be no tutorial. More complex obstacles and game mechanics will be introduced gradually as more races are won.

# User interface
When the user starts the game, the race should start right away based on the current progress of the player. There's nothing more annoying than having to wait for all the splash screens and go through many menus in order to start playing a game.

# Characters
All the race participants have the same abilities. Winning is a matter of knowing how best to avoid obstacles and finding the best timing to sprint.

# Artificial intelligence
The game should be kept simple enough to make it easy to develop the computer controlled players. In order to achieve this, the computer controlled players will be introduced early in development.
